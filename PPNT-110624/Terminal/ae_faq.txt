1.  Every character I type is displayed twice.

    In the NetTerm desktop dialog panel, turn off local echo.

2.  SecureNetTerm seems to look a little different on some of
    my workstations.

    SecureNetTerm takes advantage of video displays that can display
    more then 256 colors.  If your video card will support Hi-Color
    or True-Color (Control Panel-Display), some of the bitmaps within
    SecureNetTerm will look much better.

    SecureNetTerm also takes advantage of the advanced features found
    in Micosoft's comctl32.dll, such as the menu and toolbars.  Upon
    program startup, SecureNetTerm takes a look at the version of the
    comctl32.dll and adjusts the GUI depending upon the version.
    However, like a lot of things Microsoft does, the only way you can
    get the latest look and feel is to have the latest Microsoft Internet
    Explorer installed.  That does not mean you have to use it, just
    installed.  The more current the version of the Explorer you have,
    the more features SecureNetTerm can and will use.

3.  Several items on the menu/toolbar can be customized by editing the
    netterm2.ini file located in the Windows directory.  If you desire
    to have gray/color images displayed on the toolbar, locate the keyword
    GrayInactive=0 and set it to GrayInactive=1.  If you do not want the
    animation on the toolbar/menubar to rotate, locate the keyword
    Animate=10,3 and remove the comment (#) from the beginning of the line.
    The meaning of 10,3 is explained above it.  You can also stop/start
    the rotation by a right mouse click on the toolbar.

4.  I am having trouble pasting text into the NetTerm window.
    I am having trouble doing an ascii file transfer.

    NetTerm uses two timing values for both paste text and send
    ascii files to a host.  These can be specified by selecting
    the Options|Setup|Global Settings|File Transfer Tab.
    Normally Delay-1 should be 20 and Delay-2 should be 200.

5.  I cannot find my modem in your list of supported modems.

    Trying to keep up with all of the available modems and buying each one
    for testing would be very expensive.  We would also suggest that you
    select the TAPI option if your systems supports it.  A source for most
    modem setup strings can be found at:

         http://www.spy.net/~dustin/modem/

6.  For the Unix WordPerfect users, from one of our clients:

    A hint:  If any other Netterm users inquire about using
    your telnet with WP5.2+ for Unix, ensure they use
    386CONS as the value for the environment variable
    WPTERM52 when using KEYS-WORDPERFECT.  Even though they
    are actually using vt100 emulation, this will ensure the
    system anticipates the correct codes.

7.  I can't get the modem to be silent while dialing, why not?

    NetTerm recently changed the way it sets the modem up in order
    to handle some of the newer PCMCIA modems on the market.  If
    your current modem setup sting looks something like:

         AT %F1 M0 S11=40 S2=128

    change it to:

         AT%F1\rATM0\rATS11=40 S2=128

    The ATM0 portion of the command is what tells the modem to be
    silent.

8.  Can I use the Transparent print feature on hosts that do not support
    this feature?

    Yes, we have added a new menu item under the "File" menu called
    "Formatted Transparent Printing On".  This feature allows limited
    control and formatting of data that is normally sent only to the
    screen to be also sent to the printer using the same options that
    are available to normal transparent print requests.  The following
    two keywords in the netterm.ini control the formatting:

         FORMATPRINT_START=y^M
         FORMATPRINT_LINES=39

    The FORMATPRINT_START keyword specifies what string should be sent
    to the host to start the printout.  When the formatted transparent
    print option is selected, the internal transparent print logic is
    turned on and the FORMATPRINT_START string is sent to the host to
    indicate that the printing should be started.  The FORMATPRINT_LINES
    keyword specifies the number of lines (line feeds) that should be
    processed as one page.  When this value is reached, a form feed
    will be added to the printer data to force a new page.  Once the
    host has completed sending all the data, the 'Transparent Printing
    Off' menu item should be selected.  This will instruct NetTerm to
    print the data using the options selected in the Options-Setup-
    Global Settings-Printing dialog panel.

    Note that since both menu items that control this feature are menu
    items, QuickButtons can be defined to start and stop the transparent
    printing.
